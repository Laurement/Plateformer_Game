## Game Design Document

The game must be a plateformer (like Mario), you must be able to:

- Control a player
- The player should look where it move to (if he go to the left, he look to the left)
- The player must be able to jump
- The player can fall if he jump out a plateform (and die)
- Some enemies should exists and be able to kill the player if they touch it.
- Obviously you can add better features when you done with that.

## Technical expectations

You should code in python3 only.
You should use classes only (no functions or global)
The code should be executable as a Python package (python3 -m thegamename)
